## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production vs development environment settings
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional features
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts, SSL modes, and backup settings
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies and environment variables
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals, log formats, and debug modes
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions and deployment strategies
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists, version numbers, and quick start guides
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category and environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml (Round 2)
- **Issue**: Additional experimental features conflicting with stable config
- **Resolution**: Added experimental features behind feature flags
- **Strategy**: Maintain stability while allowing future enhancements
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 12 minutes

#### Conflict 2: scripts/deploy.sh (Round 2)  
- **Issue**: Advanced deployment options vs stable production script
- **Resolution**: Integrated advanced features as optional parameters
- **Strategy**: Added command-line arguments for experimental features
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 18 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/backup.py
- **Issue**: Different backup strategies and retention policies
- **Resolution**: Combined strategies with configurable retention
- **Strategy**: Made retention policies environment-specific
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 14 minutes

#### Conflict 4: docs/troubleshooting.md
- **Issue**: Different troubleshooting procedures and solutions
- **Resolution**: Merged both sets of solutions with environment context
- **Strategy**: Organized by problem type and environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 8 minutes

#### Conflict 5: tests/test_deploy.py
- **Issue**: Different testing approaches and mock data
- **Resolution**: Combined test cases with environment setup/teardown
- **Strategy**: Used pytest fixtures for environment isolation
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 6: CHANGELOG.md
- **Issue**: Different change histories and version tracking
- **Resolution**: Merged histories and maintained chronological order
- **Strategy**: Combined entries and removed duplicates
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 7 minutes

## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic flows. Had to understand both approaches before combining them intelligently.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial - discovered several syntax errors after initial resolution.

5. **JSON Structure Conflicts**: database-config.json required careful restructuring to maintain valid JSON syntax while merging.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process and marker interpretation
- Understood git diff for comparing branches effectively
- Learned to use git reflog as a safety net for recovery
- Practiced all major Git commands in realistic scenarios

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict completely before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing to ensure functionality
- Write detailed merge commit messages explaining resolution strategy
- Use git status frequently to track progress during complex merges
- Commit atomically with focused changes

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal collaboration events, not errors
- Taking time to understand both change contexts prevents mistakes
- When in doubt, consult team members or documentation
- Documenting resolution strategy helps future maintenance
- Regular commits reduce conflict complexity

## Reflection

This challenge transformed my perspective on merge conflicts from 
something intimidating to a normal part of collaborative development. 
I learned that conflicts are just Git's way of asking "which version 
do you want?" when it can't automatically decide.

The hands-on practice with advanced Git commands (especially rebase, 
cherry-pick, and reflog) was invaluable. I now understand the real-world 
difference between merge and rebase, and when each is appropriate. 
Most importantly, I learned that git reflog is a true lifesaver when 
things go wrong!

The systematic approach to conflict resolution - identify, understand, 
resolve, test, commit - will serve me well in professional environments. 
I feel confident handling complex merges and using Git's powerful 
version control capabilities effectively.
