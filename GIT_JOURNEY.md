## Task Summary
Cloned instructor's repository with pre-built conflicts and resolved all merge conflicts across multiple branches using proper Git workflows.

## Commands Used

| Command | Times Used | Purpose |
|---------|------------|----------|
| git clone | 1 | Clone instructor's repository |
| git checkout | 10+ | Switch between branches |
| git branch | 5+ | View and manage branches |
| git merge | 2 | Merge dev and conflict-simulator into main |
| git add | 20+ | Stage resolved conflicts |
| git commit | 11+ | Commit resolved changes |
| git push | 5+ | Push to my repository |
| git status | 15+ | Check repository state |
| git log | 8+ | View history |
| git diff | 6+ | Compare changes |

## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)
- config/app-config.yaml: Combined production and development configurations
- config/database-config.json: Created separate profiles for each environment  
- scripts/deploy.sh: Added multi-environment support with conditional logic
- scripts/monitor.js: Implemented environment-based configuration
- docs/architecture.md: Merged documentation covering both environments
- README.md: Combined feature lists and updated documentation

## Key Learnings
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
- Learned to carefully read both versions before deciding what to keep
- Practiced Git workflow best practices

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts are normal part of development workflow. The key is understanding what each side is trying to accomplish and finding the best way to combine them.
